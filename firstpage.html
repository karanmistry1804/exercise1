	<!-- Exercise 1 -->
      <h1>AWP Lecture 1</h1>
      <p>Before there were computers, there were algorithms. But now that there are computers,
		there are even more algorithms, and algorithms lie at the heart of computing.
		This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of computer
		algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in considerable
		depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. We
		have tried to keep explanations elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage
		or mathematical rigor.
