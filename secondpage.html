     <h1>AWP Exercise 4</h1>
     <p>To keep things simple, we assume, as we have for binary search trees and red-black
		trees, that any “satellite information” associated with a key resides in the same
		node as the key. In practice, one might actually store with each key just a pointer to
		another disk page containing the satellite information for that key. The pseudocode
		in this chapter implicitly assumes that the satellite information associated with a
		key, or the pointer to such satellite information, travels with the key whenever the
		key is moved from node to node. A common variant on a B-tree, known as a
		BC-tree, stores all the satellite information in the leaves and stores only keys and
		child pointers in the internal nodes, thus maximizing the branching factor of the
		internal nodes.</p>
